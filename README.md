# HTML and CSS Concepts

## Project Description
This is a personal project that helps me practice and sharpen my web development UI skills

The concepts are organized into folders. The folders are a collection of what I've been able to learn by myself/gather from the internet
and other sources.

Feel free to use the code or contribute ðŸ˜Š.
